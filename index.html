      <h4>Background on Information Technology:</h4>
      <p>I'm good at fixing computer issues. If something goes wrong with a computer, I can usually figure out what's going on and how to fix it. I've also had a background in making websites, but nothing too fancy, but I know my way around. In addition to that, I've helped set up networks for businesses. Right now, I'm thinking about learning more about cybersecurity. I want to understand how to keep computers and networks safe from hackers and potential threat within the system. It's something I'm really interested in, and I think it'll be useful to know for the future.</p>
